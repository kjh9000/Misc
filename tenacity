Here is an example algorithm for the tenacity buff for the Wintergrasp battleground in the MMORPG (online video game) 
World of Warcraft - Wrath of the Lich King. 

This algorithm assumes one level of the tenacity buff is equal to 1/6 of a player. 1/6 of a player = one tenacity point (tp).


Two examples explained:
In the first example of one tenacity, both teams have 42 tp. The first team has seven players (7 * 6) for a total of 42 tp.
The second team has six players with a base tp of 36 (6 * 6), and each player receives one tp from the tenacity buff (6 * 1).

7 * 6 = 6 * 6 + 6 * 1

In the last example of 19 tenacity, both teams have a total of 150 tp. The first team has 25 players (25 * 6) for 
a total of 150 tp. The second team has 36 base tp (6 * 6) and 114 tp from the buff (6 * 19).

25 * 6 = 6 * 6 + 6 * 19


To determine the proper amount of tenacity, simply divide the lower number of players by the higher number of players, then
apply tenacity based on the percentage within the range of the example percentages.
